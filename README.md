# Ethical Implications of Deepfake Technology

This repository contains a research article titled **"Ethical Implications of Deepfake Technology"**, developed as part of the course **POL S 534: Legal and Ethical Issues in Cyber Security** at Iowa State University under the guidance of **Prof. Matt Behrens**.

## üìÑ Overview

Deepfake technology, powered by advanced machine learning algorithms such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), has enabled the creation of hyper-realistic manipulated media. While this presents unique opportunities for creativity and innovation, it also introduces a wide range of ethical, legal, and societal challenges.

This research explores:
- The **ethical dimensions** of deepfake development, distribution, and usage
- **Real-world case studies** across politics, journalism, entertainment, and advertising
- The implications of deepfake misuse on **privacy, consent, democracy, and media trust**
- **Proactive frameworks** and solutions to mitigate risks and promote responsible innovation

## üéØ Research Questions

1. **What are the ethical considerations** surrounding deepfake technologies in various sectors?
2. **What are the enduring societal consequences** of unchecked deepfake proliferation?
3. How can **ethical frameworks and policy interventions** reduce harm and preserve digital integrity?
